# Cyclistic Case Study

This is one of the capstone projects of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course on Coursera.

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago.
I am a junior data analyst in the marketing analytics team.
The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.
Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
